# Tasks: Add Component Decomposition Rules

## Template System Overview

Templates flow: `presets/standalone/` + root `.ai/` -> `packages/cli/templates/` (via copy-templates.ts)

- **ESLint rules**: `presets/standalone/eslint-plugin-local/src/rules/`
- **Scripts**: `presets/standalone/scripts/`
- **AI guidelines**: Root `.ai/` files with `<!-- @standalone -->` marker

NOTE: `.ai/targets/AI.md` does NOT get standalone marker - it's meta-documentation for AI writing guidelines, not guidelines for standalone projects.

## 1. AI Guidelines Updates (Root .ai/ with markers)

**CRITICAL: All .ai file changes MUST comply with .ai/targets/AI.md:**
- Files under 100 lines
- ASCII only (no unicode arrows, emojis, smart quotes)
- One concern per file
- Use keywords: MUST, REQUIRED, FORBIDDEN, STOP, DETECT, BAD, GOOD
- No duplicated rules across files

**CRITICAL: Files must have `<!-- @standalone -->` marker to be copied to standalone projects**

- [x] 1.1 Update `.ai/targets/SCREENSETS.md`
  - Verify has `<!-- @standalone -->` marker
  - Add Component Placement section with decision tree
  - Add presentational criteria
  - Add placement rules for uikit/, components/, screens/*/components/
  - Keep under 100 lines - reference other files if needed

- [x] 1.2 Update `.ai/commands/hai3-new-screenset.md`
  - Verify has `<!-- @standalone -->` marker
  - **ADD CRITICAL: CLI availability check at start**
  - Add UI sections gathering in requirements
  - Add mandatory Component Planning Phase
  - Add component plan template for proposal.md
  - Require component files created BEFORE screen file

- [x] 1.3 Update `.ai/commands/hai3-new-screen.md`
  - Verify has `<!-- @standalone -->` marker
  - **ADD CRITICAL: CLI availability check**
  - Add UI sections analysis
  - Add component planning for screens
  - Add component plan template

- [x] 1.4 Update `.ai/commands/hai3-quick-ref.md`
  - Verify has `<!-- @standalone -->` marker
  - Add Component Placement section with decision tree summary
  - Add uikit vs components vs screen-local rules

- [x] 1.5 Update `.ai/commands/hai3-validate.md`
  - Verify has `<!-- @standalone -->` marker
  - Add component validation step
  - Add `hai3 validate components` command usage
  - Add component placement checks to checklist
  - Add inline style detection

- [x] 1.6 Update `.ai/commands/hai3-fix-violation.md`
  - Verify has `<!-- @standalone -->` marker
  - Add component placement violations to COMMON FIXES
  - Add inline style fixes
  - Add uikit purity fixes
  - Add inline component extraction guidance

## 2. CLI Availability Check (CRITICAL)

The following MUST be added to hai3-new-screenset.md and hai3-new-screen.md:

```markdown
## PREREQUISITES (CRITICAL - STOP IF FAILED)

BEFORE gathering requirements, verify CLI tools are available:

### Step 0.1: Check HAI3 CLI
\`\`\`bash
hai3 --version
\`\`\`
STOP CONDITION: If command fails or hai3 not found:
- Tell user: "HAI3 CLI is required but not installed. Run `npm install -g @hai3/cli` first."
- DO NOT proceed by reading peer screensets
- DO NOT attempt to manually create structure
- WAIT for user to install CLI

### Step 0.2: Check OpenSpec CLI
\`\`\`bash
npx openspec --version
\`\`\`
STOP CONDITION: If command fails:
- Tell user: "OpenSpec CLI is required. Run `npm install openspec` first."
- DO NOT proceed without proposal workflow
- WAIT for user to install OpenSpec

FORBIDDEN: Proceeding without CLI tools by copying from peer screensets.
FORBIDDEN: Creating screenset structure manually without CLI.
```

## 3. ESLint Rules (presets/standalone/eslint-plugin-local/)

These are automatically copied to templates via copy-templates.ts

- [x] 3.1 Create `presets/standalone/eslint-plugin-local/src/rules/no-inline-styles.ts`
  - Detect `style={{}}` JSX attributes
  - Detect hex color literals
  - Allow in packages/uikit/src/base/ only

- [x] 3.2 Create `presets/standalone/eslint-plugin-local/src/rules/uikit-no-business-logic.ts`
  - Detect @hai3/uicore imports in screensets/*/uikit/
  - Allow type-only imports
  - Skip icons/ folder

- [x] 3.3 Create `presets/standalone/eslint-plugin-local/src/rules/screen-inline-components.ts`
  - Detect React.FC definitions in *Screen.tsx files
  - Report as warning with extraction suggestion
  - Skip the main export default component

- [x] 3.4 Register rules in `presets/standalone/eslint-plugin-local/src/index.ts`

- [x] 3.5 Enable rules in `presets/standalone/configs/eslint.config.js`
  - `no-inline-styles`: error
  - `uikit-no-business-logic`: error
  - `screen-inline-components`: error (arch:check enforced)

- [x] 3.6 Build eslint-plugin-local
  ```bash
  cd presets/standalone/eslint-plugin-local && npm run build
  ```

## 4. CLI Validation Command

- [x] 4.1 Create `packages/cli/src/commands/validate/components.ts`
  - Implement `hai3 validate components [path]` command
  - Run validators: inlineComponents, uikitPurity, inlineStyles

- [x] 4.2 Register command in CLI entry point

- [ ] 4.3 Integrate into arch:check (OPTIONAL - not blocking)
  - Update `presets/standalone/scripts/test-architecture.ts`
  - Add component validation as third check after dependency-cruiser and knip
  - Ensure non-zero exit on component violations
  - NOTE: ESLint already runs as part of lint, CLI command is for on-demand use

## 5. ast-grep Rules - DEFERRED

Deferred: ESLint already covers inline components. Inline data array detection has high false-positive risk and is better handled during code review or AI validation.

- [x] 5.1 SKIPPED - Duplicate of ESLint screen-inline-components
- [x] 5.2 SKIPPED - Hard to detect accurately without false positives
- [x] 5.3 SKIPPED - No ast-grep rules needed

## 6. Copy Templates

- [x] 6.1 Run `npm run copy-templates` in packages/cli to update templates
  - This copies from presets/standalone/ and root .ai/ to templates/

## 7. Validation

- [x] 7.1 Verify all .ai files are under 100 lines
  - SCREENSETS.md: 98 lines
  - hai3-new-screenset.md: 83 lines
  - hai3-new-screen.md: 79 lines
  - hai3-quick-ref.md: 60 lines
  - hai3-validate.md: 48 lines
  - hai3-fix-violation.md: 50 lines
- [x] 7.2 Verify all .ai files use ASCII only (no unicode)
- [x] 7.3 Verify all standalone .ai files have `<!-- @standalone -->` marker
- [x] 7.4 Build eslint-plugin-local
- [x] 7.5 Run `npm run lint` on test screenset
  - Result: 19 errors detected (5 inline components, 5 inline styles, 9 hex colors)
- [x] 7.6 Run `npm run arch:check` to verify integration
  - Result: ESLint check fails as expected due to component violations
- [ ] 7.7 Create test standalone project via `hai3 create test-project`
- [ ] 7.8 Verify new project has all rules and guidelines

## 8. Test on Dashboards Screenset (Real-World Validation)

The `dashboards` screenset was AI-generated and has known issues. Use it to validate rules catch violations.

### 8.1 Copy Dashboards to Standalone Project
- [x] Validated directly in monorepo (dashboards screenset exists in src/screensets/dashboards/)
- [ ] OPTIONAL: Create standalone project for additional validation

### 8.2 Run ESLint and Verify Violations Detected
- [x] Run `npm run lint` - violations detected:
  - [x] `StatsCards` inline component in HomeScreen.tsx (line 128)
  - [x] `RevenueChart` inline component in HomeScreen.tsx (line 158)
  - [x] `TrafficChart` inline component in HomeScreen.tsx (line 206)
  - [x] `DevicesChart` inline component in HomeScreen.tsx (line 248)
  - [x] `ActivityCard` inline component in HomeScreen.tsx (line 289)

### 8.3 Run Component Validation
- [x] ESLint detects inline components (5 errors)
- [x] ESLint detects inline styles (5 errors in DraggableCard.tsx, etc.)
- [x] ESLint detects hex colors (9 errors in DataDisplayElements.tsx)
- [ ] CLI `hai3 validate components` command (OPTIONAL - ESLint coverage is sufficient)

### 8.4 Run arch:check
- [x] Run `npm run arch:check`
- [x] ESLint check included in output - FAILS as expected
- [x] Exit code non-zero on violations (1 CHECKS FAILED)

### 8.5 Test AI Command Flow
- [ ] Run `/hai3-new-screenset` to create a new screenset
- [ ] Verify AI asks about UI sections
- [ ] Verify AI creates Component Plan in proposal
- [ ] Verify AI creates components BEFORE screen file

### 8.6 Test Fix Workflow
- [ ] Run `/hai3-fix-violation` on one inline component
- [ ] Verify AI extracts to correct location based on decision tree
- [ ] Verify extracted component follows patterns

### 8.7 Document Results
- [ ] Record which violations were detected
- [ ] Record which violations were missed (if any)
- [ ] Create follow-up issues for any gaps

## 9. Prepare Validation Report

Create `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` in project root (temporary - delete after review):

```markdown
# Component Decomposition Rules - Validation Report

## Test Environment
- Date: {date}
- HAI3 CLI Version: {version}
